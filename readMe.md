This is a memory game project, for this project I use VanillaJavascript.
The purpose of the game is to flip all the cards with minumum amount of moves and time.
For this project I create different functions to manipulate the DOM,add eventListeners, generate random numbers, setInterval for the timer, I use css flex and order to shuffle the cards, add and remove classes.
